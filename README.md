Currently has arbitrary raid buffs with 120 sec CD (can be toggled on/off)
    6 Players each providing: +32 ATK, +2% Crit chance, and +2% ATK buff
    Based on TBT, will adjust this to a 1x of each class raid comp (with 2x Bards.)

Special Aptitudes based on old March 18 CN Technical Beta. Will updated to TBT values.
